           <p>The ability to attribute beliefs to other people is 
              known as having a “theory of mind.” (Gallagher and Frith 2003). 
              Researchers have stated that children as young as three have a 
              “primitive” theory of mind (Fodor 1992), but that this 
              “commonsense” thinking changes during “subsequent development” 
              from ages three to six (Wellman 1992) and that only by age&nbsp;five 
              or so are children able to explain why another person came to 
              a false belief (Frith and Frith 2005). It has been disputed whether 
              chimpanzees have a “rudimentary” theory of mind (id.), so the 
              ability to understand the thinking of others and how they arrived 
              at their beliefs may be a uniquely human trait that develops by 
              the end of early childhood. </p>
            <p>I have a unique memory of a moment during childhood when I first 
               became consciously aware of what I would know call “theory of mind”, 
               refined my internal theory of it, and realized that an assumption I 
               had made about it didn’t quite make sense.</p>
            <p>When I was a young child in school, I started attempting to hum a 
               tune for one of my teachers from one of the early stages of Sonic 
               the Hedgehog.  I expressed my disbelief when she stated that she 
               had never heard this music before. However, then I thought about 
               it, and realized the unconscious assumption (although I would not 
               have known those words to refer to it) that had lead me to expect 
               her to have heard of it. I had previously been using a heuristic 
               that the longer I had known about something, the more likely it 
               was for other people (most likely especially adults) to have 
               heard of it. However, at this moment, I realized this, and 
               thought to myself, “why would she have played that game? Why 
               would I think she would have played that game?” I realized that 
               there was no reason to be sure she would have played it, and that 
               there was no reason she would know that music if she hadn’t.</p>
